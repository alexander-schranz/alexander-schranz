**Hi there 👋**, My name is **Alexander Schranz** and I'm Core Developer working at the Symfony based [**Sulu CMS**](https://github.com/sulu/).

Mostly of the time I'm working with [PHP](https://github.com/php/php-src/), [Symfony](github.com/symfony/symfony/), [Sulu](github.com/sulu/sulu/), [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react), [MySQL](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server), [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis) and [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch). Also I like [GoLang](https://golang.org/) for websocket based things.

Beside my beneath and blogs on [sulu.io](https://sulu.io) website you can find the following articles here on github:

- 🖌️ [ITCSS, BEM and Rethinking Design Practices](https://github.com/alexander-schranz/itcss)
- 🥬 [Twig for React Developers](https://github.com/alexander-schranz/twig-for-react-devs)
- 🏗️ [Project "Rabbit Hole": Dig into the rabbit hole of Hexagonal Architecture](https://github.com/alexander-schranz/hexagonal-architecture-study) (work in process)

I'm happy for any feedback about my work.
